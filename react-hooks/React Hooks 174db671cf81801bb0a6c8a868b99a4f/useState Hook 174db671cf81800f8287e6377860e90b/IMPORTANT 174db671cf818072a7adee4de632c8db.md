```cpp

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Correct spelling of 'useState'
  
  const increaseCount = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);  setCount(count + 1);  setCount(count + 1);  setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increaseCount}>Increase Count</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Your code with multiple calls to `setCount` (`setCount(count + 1)` repeated four times) will not work as you might expect because React batches state updates when using the current state value directly. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Why Doesn't It Work as Expected?

When you call `setCount(count + 1)` multiple times in sequence, each call references the same current value of `count`. React does not immediately update `count` after each call but instead batches updates to optimize rendering. As a result, all four calls use the same initial value of `count` and increment it only once in total.

### Correct Way: Using a Functional Update

To correctly apply multiple increments in a single function, use the functional update form of `setCount`. This ensures that each update uses the latest state value:

### Fixed Code:

```jsx

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increaseCount = () => {
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
    setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increaseCount}>Increase Count</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```

### Key Changes:

- **Functional Updates**: `setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)` ensures that each call uses the most recent value of `count`.

### Expected Behavior:

When you click the button, the count will increase by 4 because each `setCount` call adds `1` to the latest value of `count`.

### Alternate Approach: Incrementing by 4 Directly

If the goal is simply to increment the count by 4, you can simplify it:

```jsx

const increaseCount = () => {
  setCount(count + 4);
};

```

This avoids multiple state updates and achieves the same result. Choose the method that best fits your use case!
