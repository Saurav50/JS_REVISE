# 2. Hoisting

In JavaScript, *hoisting* is the process by which variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase, before code execution. This means that you can reference variables and functions before they are actually declared in the code.

Here's how hoisting works for different declarations:

### 1. **Function Declarations**

Functions declared using the `function` keyword are fully hoisted, so you can call them before they appear in the code.

```jsx

greet(); // Output: "Hello!"
console.log(greet)// whole fn is outputted

function greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}

```

### 2. **Var Declarations**

Variables declared with `var` are hoisted, but only the declaration (not the initialization). This means they are defined at the top of their scope with an initial value of `undefined`.

```jsx

console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 5;
console.log(x); // Output: 5

```

In this example, `var x` is hoisted to the top, but the assignment `x = 5` is not.

### 3. **Let and Const Declarations**

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are also hoisted but differ from `var` in that they are not initialized to `undefined`. They remain in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is encountered, meaning accessing them before declaration throws a `ReferenceError`.

```jsx

console.log(y); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
let y = 10;

```

### Key Takeaways

- Function declarations are fully hoisted.
- `var` declarations are hoisted and initialized to `undefined`.
- `let` and `const` declarations are hoisted but are not initialized, resulting in a temporal dead zone.
