# Promise API

### 1. `Promise.all`

- Resolves when **all promises** in the array resolve.
- If **any promise rejects**, it immediately rejects with that error.

### 2. `Promise.allSettled`

- Waits for **all promises to settle** (either resolve or reject).
- Returns an array of objects with the results for each promise (status and value or reason).

### 3 . `Promise.race`

- Resolves or rejects as soon as the **first promise** settles (either resolves or rejects).
- Useful when you want the fastest response and don't need all promises to complete.

### 4. `Promise.any`

- Resolves as soon as the **first promise resolves**.
- If all promises reject, it rejects with an `AggregateError` containing all errors.

```jsx
const p1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve("P1 Success"), 3000);
  //setTimeout(() => reject("P1 Fail"), 3000);
});

const p2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve("P2 Success"), 5000);
  //setTimeout(() => reject("P2 Fail"), 5000);
});

const p3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve("P3 Success"), 2000);
 // setTimeout(() => reject("P3 Fail"), 2000);
});

Promise.any([p1, p2, p3])
  .then((res) => {
    console.log(res);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(err);
  });
