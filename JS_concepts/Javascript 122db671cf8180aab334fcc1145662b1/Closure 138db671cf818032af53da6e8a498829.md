# Closure

function bundled with its lexical environment is termed as closure

```jsx
function y() {
  var a = 10;

  function x() {
    console.log(a); // Accesses variable from outer function's scope
  }

  return x;
}

const z = y();
z(); // Outputs: 10
```

- The inner function can access variables from three scopes:
    - Its own local scope
    - The outer functionâ€™s scope
    - The global scope
- The closure keeps the variables of the outer function alive, allowing the inner function to use and even modify these variable

Applications : currying, function once, setTimeouts

1. An inner function can be directly called using two parenthesis ()().
2. Even parameters can be passed this way (Remember that the function needs to be returned to do this)
3. Closures can also be used for data hiding and encapsulation. So other code cannot access this value.
4. Unused variables are automatically deleted in High Level Programming language by garbage collector. Closures allocate a lot of memory which cannot be deleted so this acts as a disadvantage.
5. Some browsers now have smart garbage collectors that automatically deletes variables that are not used outside closures.
