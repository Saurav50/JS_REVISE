# Promises

1. Before promise we used to depend on callback functions which would result in 1.) Callback Hell (Pyramid of doom) | 2.) Inversion of control
2. Inversion of control is overcome by using promise.
2.1) A promise is an object that represents eventual completion/failure of an asynchronous operation.

2.2) A promise has 3 states: pending | fulfilled | rejected.
2.3) As soon as promise is fulfilled/rejected => It updates the empty object which is assigned undefined in pending state.
2.4) A promise resolves only once and it is immutable.
2.5) Using .then() we can control when we call the cb(callback) function.

1. To avoid callback hell (Pyramid of doom) => We use promise chaining. This way our code expands vertically instead of horizontally. Chaining is done using '.then()'

1. A very common mistake that developers do is not returning a value during chaining of promises. Always remember to return a value. This returned value will be used by the next .then()
