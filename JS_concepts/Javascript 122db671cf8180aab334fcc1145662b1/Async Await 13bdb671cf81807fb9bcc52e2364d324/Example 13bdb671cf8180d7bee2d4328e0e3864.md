# Example

Here’s an example demonstrating how `await` doesn’t block the JavaScript engine. In this case, while our `async` function "waits" for a promise to resolve, other code outside the `async` function can still run.

### Example

```jsx
javascript
Copy code
console.log("1: Starting the process");

async function asyncFunction() {
    console.log("2: Async function started");

    // Simulate a delay with a promise that resolves after 2 seconds
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));

    console.log("4: Async function resumed after await");

asyncFunction();

console.log("3: Code outside async function is still running");

```

### Output

```vbnet

1: Starting the process
2: Async function started
3: Code outside async function is still running
4: Async function resumed after await

```

### Explanation

- **Step 1**: "1: Starting the process" is logged first.
- **Step 2**: The `asyncFunction()` is called, and "2: Async function started" is logged.
- **Step 3**: The `await` line inside `asyncFunction()` encounters the 2-second promise. At this point, the function pauses, and control is returned to the call stack.
- **Step 4**: "3: Code outside async function is still running" is logged immediately, even though the `asyncFunction` hasn’t completed, showing that JavaScript continues to run other code.
- **Step 5**: After the 2-second delay, the `asyncFunction()` resumes and logs "4: Async function resumed after await."

This demonstrates that JavaScript does not actually “wait” for `await` statements; it merely suspends that function temporarily while the call stack stays open for other tasks.
